Had some problem with the files so uploaded the zipfile instead.

This is a project about REST and we made a simple website with JSF & a derby database.
The idea we had was developing a site in which you can build your own computer by selecting different hardware.
Then you get a price for the computer and you can "place an order" in wich the program saves the choices you made along with the price & an ordernumber.

And along with this we made a REST layer and also an client in which you can access the different methods.
